You are in an infinite-size plane, which looks like a dog heaven.

You ask Spot to tell you about the future, and he tells you that you will die in 10 minutes.
You ask Spot to tell you about the past, and he tells you that you were a dog in your past life.
You ask Spot to tell you about the present, and he tells you that you are a dog in your present life.
Occasionally, Spot will tell you about his past life, and his present life.
Occasionally, Spot will add woofs to his sentences.
